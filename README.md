First download all the files in a folder, and for analysing rSNN spike pattern run MSVL1.m in MATLAB, for BiLSTM classification run BiLSTM_pattern.m. 
MSVL and Spike Detection Algorithm has been introduced by the paper, titled"Diagnostic biomarker discovery from brain EEG data with LSTM, reservoir-SNN and NeuCube: Methods and a pilot study on epilepsy vs migraine"
